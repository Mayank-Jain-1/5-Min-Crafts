    <h2>How You Can Spend This Money</h2>

    <p>
      At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
      facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
      and technology. You <em>seem</em> like an intelligent, dedicated
      researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
      Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as
      follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures
        exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for
        representing musical scores.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
      including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
      other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I
      <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my
      favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
      <dd>
        A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr
          title="Before Christ"
          >BC</abbr
        >, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to
        encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
      </dd>
      <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
      <dd>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
        used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a
        circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that
        he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
      </dd>
      <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
      <dd>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in
        the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by
        "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern
        Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were
        just moving like this because they were really cold.
